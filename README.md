## PY-BEMCS Demo

<p align="center">
  <i>This simulation demonstrates Xe+ beam extraction of a dual-grid ion optics system for Vscreen=1650V and Va=-350V ,n_plasma=1e16/m3 without a neutralizer. As the primary and the CEX ions erode the screen/accelerator grid, geometry and potential barriers evolve in time. The secondary electrons are emitted due to the impact of primary beam ions and the charge exchange ions on the grids.</i>

### Core Physics

- **Vectorized particle updates** for high-throughput runtime performance.
- **Artificial electron mass approximation (m_e = M_ion/1000)** to speed up the simulation time.
- **Self-consistent beam extraction** from plasma meniscus and Bohm criteria.
- **CEX collision modeling** with probabilistic scattering (Birdsall/Roy plume model), or user-imported cross-section data.
- **Dynamic erosion and failure logic** due to CEX ions with in-situ remeshing behavior.
- **RF-based Coextraction** of electron and ion beam.
- **User-defined multi-grid beam extraction** for different kinds of sources.

### Configurable Ion Beam Species (Menubar: Beam > Ion Species)
- Define the beam ion by **atomic/molecular mass** (amu) and **charge state** (+1, +2, etc.).
- Built-in presets for common species: Xe, Kr, Ar, N2, O2, H2, He, Hg, Cs.
- Custom mass and charge for any user-defined ion.

### Cross-Section Data Import (Menubar: Beam > Cross-Section Manager)
- Import CSV tables of **Energy (eV) vs Cross-Section (m^2)** for different reaction channels:
  - Charge Exchange (CX)
  - Secondary Electron Yield (SEE)
  - Custom reactions (e.g., air-mixture gas interactions)
- **Visualise** imported data on a log-log plot.
- **Fit a cubic spline** (in log-log space) with adjustable smoothing so that intermediate energy values are interpolated during the simulation.
- Multiple datasets can be loaded, inspected, and removed.
- When a fitted CX or SEE spline is present it automatically replaces the built-in analytical model during the run.

### Grid Material Selection (Menubar: Materials > Grid Material)
- Choose from built-in presets or define fully custom properties:

| Material | k (W/m/K) | rho (kg/m^3) | cp (J/kg/K) | alpha (1/K) | E (GPa) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Molybdenum | 138 | 10 280 | 250 | 4.8e-6 | 329 |
| Steel (SS316) | 16.3 | 8 000 | 500 | 16.0e-6 | 193 |
| Titanium | 21.9 | 4 507 | 520 | 8.6e-6 | 116 |
| Graphite | 120 | 2 200 | 710 | 3.0e-6 | 11 |

- Configurable parameters: thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, emissivity, thermal expansion coefficient, Young's modulus, sputter yield coefficient, and sputter threshold energy.

### Cantilever Thermal Deformation
- Grids deform like a **cantilever beam**: clamped at the top wall (`Y = Ly`), free at the aperture edge (`Y = r`).
- Tip deflection driven by thermal stress: `delta = alpha * dT * L^2 / (2*t)`.
- Quadratic (Euler-Bernoulli) deflection profile applied to the grid boundary mask, producing visible bowing in the beam trajectory plot.
- Materials with high thermal expansion and low conductivity (e.g., Steel) exhibit significantly faster deformation than refractory metals (e.g., Mo).

### Python Multiphysics Additions
- **Poisson field update with space charge** using both ion and electron density contributions.
- **Neutralizer electron model** with configurable electron injection rate and electron temperature.
- **Thermal-erosion coupling** with simulation modes:
  - `Both`
  - `Thermal`
  - `Erosion`
- **Thermal monitoring** for screen and accelerator grids.

### Visualization and Data Export

- Live plasma and damage-map plots.
- Electron backstreaming and beam divergence telemetry.
- Grid temperature map visualization.
- CSV export (iteration, electron backstreaming potential, divergence, grid temperatures).
- Particle kinematics export (time, position, velocity, energy, particle type).
- GIF recording/export via Pillow.

### Hardware Acceleration

- **Taichi backend (GPU-ready)**: particle push (Boris), charge-density
  deposition, and 2D thermal conduction compile through Taichi. On
  machines with a CUDA/Metal/Vulkan GPU the kernels run on the GPU in
  32-bit precision; on CPU-only machines they run in 64-bit. Toggle the
  three commented lines at the top of `Python/physics_engine.py` to
  switch between `ti.gpu` (f32) and `ti.cpu` (f64).
- **Poisson solver**: runs on the CPU by default (SciPy SuperLU). An
  optional CuPy GPU path exists but is disabled by default — CuPy's
  sparse LU has too much kernel-launch overhead for small grids (~30k
  unknowns) and SciPy wins. Flip `_USE_GPU_POISSON = True` in
  `Python/physics_engine.py` to experiment on larger grids.
- **Smooth GUI under long runs**: matplotlib plots refresh every 20
  physics steps using reusable `pcolormesh` artists, `canvas.draw_idle()`
  for coalesced repaints, and `QApplication.processEvents()` between
  physics steps so the Qt event loop never starves during heavy runs.

## Installation and Usage

### MATLAB Workflow

1. Prerequisite: MATLAB R2015b or newer.
2. Open MATLAB in the repository root.
3. Run:

```matlab
TransientDigitalTwin  % Grid erosion and EOL study
charge_exchange_code  % Plume/CEX study
```

### Python Workflow (Recommended, Modular)

#### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment

Python 3.10+ is required (3.12 recommended). From the repository root:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
python3 -m venv Python/.venv
source Python/.venv/bin/activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
py -3 -m venv Python\.venv
Python\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Upgrade `pip` inside the venv before installing:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 2. Install core dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib PyQt5 Pillow taichi
```

Taichi auto-selects a GPU backend (CUDA / Metal / Vulkan) at startup if
one is available. Nothing else to configure.

#### 3. (Optional) Install CuPy for GPU Poisson

Only needed if you plan to experiment with the CuPy-based Poisson
solver on **very large grids**. The code runs fine without it. On
Linux with an NVIDIA GPU and a recent driver:

```bash
pip install 'cupy-cuda12x<14' \
  nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cusparse-cu12 nvidia-cusolver-cu12 \
  nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12 nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12 \
  nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12 nvidia-curand-cu12 nvidia-cufft-cu12
```

`main.py` self-heals `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so the bundled NVIDIA wheels are
discovered automatically — no need to set it manually. To actually turn
on the GPU Poisson solver, edit `Python/physics_engine.py` and set
`_USE_GPU_POISSON = True` (it is `False` by default).

#### 4. Launch the GUI app

```bash
python Python/main.py
```

> **Qt + OpenFOAM users:** If your shell sources OpenFOAM (or any toolchain
> that injects `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` into `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), the system
> Qt libraries can shadow PyQt5's bundled copies and cause
> `Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb"`. `main.py` now self-heals by
> prepending the PyQt5 wheel's own `Qt5/lib` directory (and any bundled
> NVIDIA CUDA wheel `lib/` folders) to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and re-exec-ing
> once; a shell-level equivalent is also provided as `Python/run.sh`.

#### 5. Or run headless from a configuration file

```bash
python Python/run_simulation_from_config.py
```

Edit `Python/config.ini` to set beam species, grid material, cross-section file paths, grid geometry, plasma parameters, and terminal output options.

### Python Workflow (Legacy Single File)

```bash
python Python/TrainsientDigitalTwin.py
```
